# Code

1) this website has four main pages

   (login, dashboard, update, error).

2) I used Hash Routing.

3) First Page is login page, use this      
   email and password, otherwise you       
   won't be able to log in.
   
   email: eve.holt@reqres.in
  
   password: cityslicka

4) After Login a dashboard page appears,
   I am displaying a table in it, data is 
   coming from a mock api, you can do    
   (edit, delete, logout, searching) in    
   it, I also stored token in  
   localStrorage after login.

5) If you don't logout, you can directly 
   go to the dashboard page without  
   login, until you logout your profile.

6) I also authenticate the url routing.

7) Dependencies : npm i bootstrap axios
   react-router-dom
